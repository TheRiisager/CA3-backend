Due to personal stuff and lack of time i did not manage to do the second part of this project. <br>
I will, however, outline what i had in mind for it:<br>
*A backend that, in addition to the stock login stuff, would make requests to a few different external apis and generate a combined JSON object for use as data in a personal dashboard-like thing.<br>
*A frontend that would display the aforementioned data in cards, where you could click on each one to expand it (making a relevant API call). This would only be available after login
